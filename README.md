# WeatherAppReact

Made a Weather App with the use of React/TailWind CSS/ API (openweathermap.org)/Toast

The only downfall for this project on the API it now has made changes that went from free to a $180 USD/Month to get the API key

To run this program 
1. Open VSCode
2. Start React-environment on terminal type to make a new folder "npx -create-react-app (name of new folder)"
3. add my files to the SRC folder
4. Upload the files into your IDE (VSCode)
5. On the file "Weather Service" input your API that you subscribed to into openweathermap.org to get access
6. On terminal run "npm start"
7. It will open up into local web server displaying weather from many different countries.
